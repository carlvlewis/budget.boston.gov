      Under Go Boston 2030, Boston will strive for streets that are safer for  all users of our roads and sidewalks, particularly pedestrians and cyclists,  travel that is more reliable and predictable, and quality transportation  choices that improve access, to interconnect our neighborhoods for all  modes of travel.</li>

      lane \n  markings, and bike lanes into a state of good repair.</li>\n  <li>Continues
      the City’s $3.1 million annual investment in \n  <a href=\"http://www.visionzeroboston.org/\">Vision
      Zero</a> to \n  make targeted safety improvements at corridors and intersections
      with known \n  safety challenges, and to traffic-calm residential streets.</li>\n
      \ <li>Improves access and safety for those visiting our \n  <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/economic-development/boston-main-streets\">Main
      \n  Street business</a> districts on foot and on bicycles including Hyde Square,
      Central Square \n  and Dudley Street.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  - col: "<ul>\n  <li>Starts the transformation of the City’s upgrade to the next
      generation \n  of traffic signal technology, with an initial focus on some of
      our busiest \n  corridors and bus routes. This will mean fewer delays for everyone
      and better \n  coordination across signals.</li>\n  <li>Focuses on adding protected
      bicycle lanes on every “Great Streets” project, \n  including Melnea Cass Boulevard
      and Commonwealth Avenue, and on Multi-Use Paths \n  such as the Fenway-Roxbury
      Connector, all complemented by continuing the $900,000 \n  annual investment
      in the Strategic Bike Network.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  - col: "<ul>\n  <li>Funds a multi-year program to create improved and — in many
      cases — \n  signalized intersections in some of the more challenging locations
      in the City. \n  This includes the Father Hart Bridge/Wolcott Square area in
      Hyde Park.</li>\n  <li>Puts the City on a sustainable capital program to maintain
      bridges, roads, \n  sidewalks, off-street paths, street lighting, and building
      facilities essential \n  to the high-quality delivery of services.</li>\n</ul>\n"
