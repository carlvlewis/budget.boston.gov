    short_desc: 'As mentioned in the BPS Long Term Financial Plan, four of the five
      main drivers that attribute to  yearly budgetary challenges at BPS are cost
      related. BPS spends 45% more per  pupil than comparable districts.

      transportation \n  of the 200 largest districts in the country.</li>\n  <li>Boston
      spends 3.1 times more on transportation costs per Special Education student
      \n  than comparison districts.  BPS has seen an increased number of students
      assigned to \n  door-to-do pick-up versus corner bus stop pick-up.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  - col: "<ul>\n  <li>Due to the size of Boston’s school buildings, BPS’ elementary
      schools are 140 \n  students smaller while their secondary schools are 220 students
      smaller than peer districts. \n  This causes BPS to spend 35% more per-pupil
      on school-based administration services.</li>\n</ul>\n"
  - col: "<ul>\n  <li>20% of BPS students receive special education services compared
      to the national average \n  of 13%. BPS spends nearly one fourth of its budget
      on special education, which is 53% \n  greater than the comparison average.</li>\n
      \ <li>BPS also pays teachers more than comparison districts on average (adjusted
      for cost \n  of living). BPS total compensation is 29% higher than the comparison
      average and \n  the average teacher salary is over $90,000 even before healthcare
      and pension costs.</li>\n</ul>\n"
