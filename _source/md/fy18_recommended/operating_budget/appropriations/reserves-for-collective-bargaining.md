    description: 'Most union contracts in City departments expired in FY17. Salary
      increases in these agreements will have a major impact on dollars available
      in FY18 and in the upcoming years. The FY18 collective bargaining reserves,
      a $20 million reserve for Boston Public Schools and a $27 million reserve for
      City departments including the Public Health Commission, contain funding for
      successor agreements.  These reserves account for $31 million of the growth
      in the FY18 Budget.
